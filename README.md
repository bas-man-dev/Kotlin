# Kotlin Revisited

## Why did I change?

I started learning Ruby on Rails but it kept breaking on me. I think the OS was trying to update some features wich kind of messed up the 'gems' in Ruby on Rails.

Until I can find a fix, I decided to revisit Kotlin again, try to see if the knowledge I gained from learning Java has helped improve my Kotlin skills.
